#### Replicating portfolio using React

After having followed a [React tutorial on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/playlist/p7P5Hd), wich I **highly** recommend for those who want to start somewhere with this framework, I'm am now planning on replicating my portfolio website using ... well ... React. 

This won't be something too fancy, but it will be interesting to see how long it will take me to get this up and running. 

I'm also planning on improving it along the way, so we'll see how this turns out.

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
